# Virūpākṣa ( विरूपाक्ष )

_King of the west and one who sees all. His symbolic weapon is a snake or red cord that is representative of a dragon. As the eye in the sky, he sees people who do not believe in Buddhism and converts them. His ancient name means "he who has broad objectives"._

This is just a common place where I store my Python experiments. The mythical imagery is just for fun.

```
C:\...\pyproj> my_env\Scripts\activate
